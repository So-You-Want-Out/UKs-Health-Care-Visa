# UKs-Health-Care-Visa

UK work permits don't normally encompass low skilled work but the health care visa now includes senior carers, health care assistants and other caregivers. You need a job offer that pays at least Â£10.10 per hour. 

Most training is done by care homes, although it is generally suggested that you earn the theory portion of the care certificate so you can put it in your resume. Here is a free one: https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/care-certificate/

The visa lasts for one year but can be renewed for two years. This visa can lead to citizenship or permanent residency in 5 years.
